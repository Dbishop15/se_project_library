            At this event, which celebrates the library's namesake, our guest
            lecturer will take us on a journey exploring some of the most
            prominent female researchers in the world of space science. It's
            easy to buy into the misconception that this field was mostly
            dominated by men, but our lecture aims to change that notion and
            prove that this hasn't been the case since at least the 18th
            century.

                In this installment of the Harry Potter series, the character really starts to face life or death situations now that voldemort has returned. Harry's struggles get really complicated because he and Dumbledore are seemingly the only people that believe Voldemort has actually returned.  Harry also explores some very real feelings for Choe which makes his personal very complicated along with teaching his peers how to defend themselves against very real threats. It is one of the more exciting installments in the series.

                In this book, Harry is tasked with finding some crucial information from the new defense against the dark arts teacher in order to defeat Voldemort for good.  Dumbeldore starts to unveil to Harry the enormity of the task before him and even takes Harry along to destroy one of the dreaded horcruxes that allows Voldemort to resurrect himself.  Voldemort himself begins to build his army to it's former glory and enlists Draco Malffoy to be Dumbeldores executioner.  The book ending with the death of the beloved headmaster was probably one of the most earth shattering events that shook all Harry Potter fans to their core.

                This installment of the series was the only time I ever went to a book opening in Barnes and Noble.  I waited in a fairly long line to purchase this long awaited conclusion to the series.  This book brought about so many questions for Harry Potter since he was essentially on his own to find the remaining horcruxes with only Ron and Hermoine to accompany him.  There were so many questions ranging from what were the remaining horcruxes to how on earth were they going to be able to destroy if they were able to find them.  I had to read the book a couple of times to truly take in all the amazing plot twists and mysteries that had to be solved in order for Harry to live.  I think my most treasured memory was reading the part where Harry went into the forest to confront Voldemort and was able to speak with his family by utilizing the resurrection stone.  I truly appreciate how the author wrapped up the iconic series.

                After finishing the Harry Potter series, this new fantasy book was recommended to me by a close friend.  This book series revolved around a few characters who all came from the same village.  In this world, women are the all knowing sorcerers who use a special power that allows them to perform magic.  Men do have access to this one power but become mad through it's use because the dragon infected it a long time ago.  The Dragon was a supreme male sorcerer who was prophesized to either break the world or save it.  Although this mythical sorcerer had passed long ago, it was said that he would be resurrected once more and the world would be in peril with his coming.  Rand Al Thor is this resurrected master sorcerer and the story follows him and his friends as they navigate a fast changing world.

          <p class="about__paragraph">
            Libraries are essential establishments in practically every city,
            and Practicum's library is no exception. It first opened its doors
            way back in 2018, right as our humble town began bidding welcome to
            its very first citizens!
          </p>
          <p class="about__paragraph">
            Since its initial opening, the library has seen nearly 342 visitors
            each month. That's almost 50% of our population! So far, most
            citizens have enjoyed reading books and making use of our ample
            online resources.
          </p>
          <p class="about__paragraph">
            The library gets its name from Joan Feynman, an American
            astrophysicist and the first woman to be elected as an officer of
            the American Geophysical Union.
